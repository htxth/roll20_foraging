# Roll20 Foraging and search Herbs
This is a Roll20 API script for generating random herbs.

Create this macro for easy use of the script

---!herbs ?{Choose a Terrain|common|arctic|coastal|desert|forest|grasslands|hills|mountain|swamp|underdark|vulcanic}---

I used many house rules for this script. You can expand the herbs cataloge inside the script or change the parameter. Follow this process:
1. the script rollo 1d100 and sees if there is some intresting herbs on the road.
2. if there is some intresting herbs, roll random and show ONLY to GM the herbs, foraging DC and all information about it
3. player can roll on survival to notice the herbs o  nature to identify the herbs

Some note: for a  characterthat search herbs for 30 minutes i use this method once. If charachter has advantage i use three time in 30 minutes.

Have a nice roll20
